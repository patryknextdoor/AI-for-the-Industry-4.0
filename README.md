AI for the Industry 4.0  - RECRUITMENT TASK


The objective of this project is to develop an accurate model for predicting sensor characteristics in water and isopropanol based on measurements in air, thereby enabling a reduction in the validation process. To achieve this, I have first converted the signals into the frequency domain, which helps in better understanding the characteristics of the signals. Furthermore, I have attempted to extract features from the signals to analyze them further.

Moving forward, I have decided to use a supervised learning approach, treating the problem as a regression problem. I will apply several regression models and compare and evaluate their performance. This will help me to identify the most accurate model for predicting sensor characteristics in water and isopropanol based on measurements in air. By using such a model, one can reduce the validation process and potentially save time and resources.

In summary, I have explored various techniques and models to develop an accurate prediction model for sensor characteristics. Besides the supervised learning approach, there are other potential methods that one could consider. Additionally, one could also consider several characteristics, such as sensitivity or response time , which may influence the performance of the sensor in different environments.
